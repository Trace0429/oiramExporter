Some of the sample code specifies these channels as PART_* as opposed to *_CHANNEL.
For example, PART_GEOM|PART_TOPO instead of GEOM_CHANNEL|TOPO_CHANNEL. 
The proper usage is the *_CHANNEL version.

The pipeline is divided into the following channels: */

//! \brief The topology channel - the face or polygon structures. 
/*! Smoothing groups and materials are also part of this channel. 
Edge visibility is also part of this channels since it is an attribute of the face structure. */
#define TOPO_CHANNEL    	(1<<0)

/*! Most modifiers only alter this channel. */

//! \brief This is no longer used. 
/*! Materials are rolled into the Face data structure and are part of the topology channel. */
#define MTL_CHANNEL     	(1<<3)
//! \brief The sub-object selection channel. 
/*! An object's selection flows down the pipeline. What the selection is actually 
comprised of is up to the specific object type. For example, TriObjects have bits 
for face, edge and vertex selection. This channel is the actual BitArray used, 
like selLevel of the class Mesh. */
#define SELECT_CHANNEL  	(1<<4)
//! \brief The current level of selection
/*! Every object that flows down the pipeline is at a certain level that corresponds 
to the Sub-Object drop down in the 3ds Max user interface. This channel indicates 
which level the object is at. This is also specific to the object type. There are 
32 bits to represent the level of selection. When all the bits are 0, the object 
is at object level selection. */
#define SUBSEL_TYPE_CHANNEL (1<<5)
//! \brief The miscellaneous bits controlling the item's display. 
/*! These bits are specific to the type of object. For the Mesh object these 
are the surface normal scale, display of surface normals, edge visibility and display flags. */
#define DISP_ATTRIB_CHANNEL (1<<6)
//! \brief The color per vertex channel. 
/*! This is also used for the second texture mapping channel. */
#define VERTCOLOR_CHANNEL   (1<<7)

/*! Plug-In developers don't need to specify this channel as being changed or used in their plug-ins. */
