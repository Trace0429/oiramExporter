/** Provides various methods to emit pieces of script to the Macro
 * Recorder. There are also methods to specify the nature of the scripts generated
 * by the user operating 3ds Max. Additionally there are methods to enable or
 * disable the recording of scripts.
 * This class may be used by plug-ins but is also used internally as part of the
 * 3ds Max Macro Recorder. Inside key areas of 3ds Max macro scripts are emitted
 * corresponding to the operation being performed. For example when a call goes to
 * a parameter block to set a value 3ds Max internally call this classes method
 * ParamBlock2SetValue(...) to emit script to record the change. Thus, many
 * operations a plug-in performs are recorded automatically. There are however
 * operations a plug-in can perform which won't be recorded automatically. In
 * these cases methods of this class may be used to emit script to record these
 * operations.
 * Several of the functions in this class use an ellipsis argument (...).
 * This ellipsis is the var-args style of passing information to a method. This
 * allows a developer to pass a variable number of values to the method. These are
 * typically a set of tag values followed by some C++ types. The sample code shown
 * with many of the methods shows how this is done. For a starting point for more
 * general information on variable argument lists see va_arg in the Window
 * help file. An instance of the MacroRecorder can be retrieved using the function 
 * Interface::GetMacroRecorder().
 * \see ClassDesc, INode, IParamBlock, IParamBlock2, Matrix3, ReferenceTarget.
