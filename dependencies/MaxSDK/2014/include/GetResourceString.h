 * \deprecated Deprecated in Max 2013. Use MaxSDK::GetResourceStringAsMSTR instead.
 * \brief Extract a resource from a module's string table.
 * GetResourceString is essentially a wrapper around the Win32 API's LoadString,
 * but it saves client code from the bother of maintaining a buffer and 
 * reduces duplicated code. Optimally, GetResourceString should be called
 * through the single-parameter version from dllutilities.h.
 *
 * Note that this uses a static buffer internally, and is therefore not thread-
 * safe.  Furthermore, if a client needs multiple resource strings 
 * simultaneously, it must copy GetResourceString's result locally before
 * making a subsequent call.
 *
 * \param hinstance Handle to the module whose string table will be queried
 * for the resource.
 * \param resourceId Identifier for the desired string resource within the
 * given module's string table.
 * \return Pointer to a null-terminated character string, or null if the 
 * requested resource is not found.
